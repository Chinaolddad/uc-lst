<p1>This project created as the automates Drive cleaner script.<p1/>
  
I add the common file types as the target for system folders. like .tmp .log .obj.etc
Also add the common file types as the target for daily use folders. like .txt.jpg.png.etc
The file size are def as the byte plz conversion before use.
Which can easly change the target by edit the script.
What more is I set filter of file size.
