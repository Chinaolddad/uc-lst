<h1>This project created as the automates Drive cleaner script.</h1> 
<body><br/>

I add the common file types as the target for system folders. like .tmp .log .obj.etc <br/>
  
Also add the common file types as the target for daily use folders. like .txt.jpg.png.etc <br/>
  
The file size are def as the byte plz conversion before use. <br/>
  
Which can easly change the target by edit the script. <br/>

What more is I set filter of file size.  <br/>
