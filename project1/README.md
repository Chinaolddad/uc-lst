<h1>This project created as the automates Drive cleaner script.</h1> 
<body>
<p>

I add the common file types as the target for system folders. like .tmp .log .obj.etc 
  
Also add the common file types as the target for daily use folders. like .txt.jpg.png.etc 
  
The file size are def as the byte plz conversion before use. 
  
Which can easly change the target by edit the script. 

What more is I set filter of file size.

For operating, you just need input the folder path.

<h3>
For project 2 I add the another filter which could set the time. This allows us to delete files from a fixed number of days ago, even if the file size does not match the value previously set, to clear long-term redundant files
</h3>

  <h1>project3 the cleaning 3.0 </h1>
  <p2>
    This time I did add the operation interface for my clean app. For using import project3-1&2 and run project 1 that you will see the interface. I did not packaging this app so this is not exe file.
